1. Incident commander name: PhongVM
2. Executive Summary of what happened:
	The attacker deployed three crypto-mining pods on the production cluster, taking control of the system and using its CPU resources for mining.
3. Summary of what was affected:
	The attacker ran crypto-mining containers, which caused a significant increase in CPU usage, affecting system performance.
4. Summmry of the impact:
	The rise in CPU usage could slow down other containers on the same node and make Kubernetes core components like kubectl, the control panel, and kube-proxy unresponsive
5. Summary of the remediation steps:
	1. Remove the mining pods by running:
	kubectl --kubeconfig kube_config_cluster.yml delete pod <pod_name> --force
	2. Check the CPU usage on the Grafana dashboard to ensure the usage drops after removing the pods.
6. Summary of lessons learned:
	- Use admission controllers to block unauthorized images from running in pods.
	- Improve CPU monitoring and alerting to catch issues like this more quickly.
	- Set higher priorities for Falco rules on metrics to ensure critical alerts are seen sooner.
